# The Village: card game

From [Werewolf](https://github.com/GreyWolfDev/Werewolf) project, I created another Telegram bot to assist human narrators in creating balanced games and handling chance-driven events during the game.

With this bot is possible to:
- Create balanced games and check balance for custom games
- Generate Werewolf random events outcomes
- Introduce custom roles providing balance value
